#Skills Assessment 1
#*Make sure that you have forked the main repo! Do not push changes to the main repo, only to your fork!*

##*This repo is an opportunity for you to get an accurate measure of where you're starting in the class!*

This repo is not a test, and there is no pass / fail grade. This is an exercise designed to let you define your current knowledge of Python and JavaScript. It will give you confidence in the areas where you are strong, and an honest assessment of the areas where you can improve. 

####It's important that you perform the tasks in this repo on your own.

If you get help from someone else, you are only cheating yourself. The whole point of the exercise is to make an honest assessment of where your skills are. Only then will you know where you really stand.

* It's OK to use any available reference material, including Google, StackOverflow, etc.
* It's NOT OK to copy and paste code.
* Don't stress. Once again, this is not a test.

####You have 1 hour to complete this repo. After that time you will need to commit your changes and push to __your__ fork of the master repo.

##Goals

This assessment consists of 2 practical coding segments, one for JavaScript and one for Python. You do not have to complete these in any particular order. If you are having trouble with one part, skip to the next. Do all of the work that you are comfortable with first and come back to the difficult sections later. Complete what you can.

###Code Exercises

####JavaScript

Complete the following:

* open the file called `skills01.js` and complete the code as described in the comments.
  * be sure to leave the comments in place, and write your code between the comments.
  * follow best practices for indenting your code, and feel free to add spacing for readability.
  * if you want to test your code, you can copy and paste it into the Chrome console or into 'Repl.it' at http://repl.it/languages/JavaScript.

####Python

Complete the following:

* open the file called `skills01.py` and complete the code as described in the comments.
  * be sure to leave the comments in place, and write your code between the comments.
  * follow best practices for indenting your code, and feel free to add spacing for readability.
  * if you want to test your code, you can copy and paste it into 'Repl.it' at http://repl.it/languages/Python.

##All Done!

When you're finished, commit your changes and push your code to your fork on github.

Congratulations on completing your first assessment!
