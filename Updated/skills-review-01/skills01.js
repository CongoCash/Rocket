//Declare a variable. Use any variable name that you like.
//Your code goes here:


//*****
//You have already declared a variable, now assign a number to it. It can be any number.
//Your code goes here:



//*****
//Declare a new variable with any name you like. Make up a string value and assign it to the variable. Do all of this in one statement.
//Your code goes here:



//*****
//In one line, declare a variable and assign an empty array to that variable.
//Your code goes here:

//*****
//Using the array variable you just created, write a 'for' loop that counts from 1 to 10 and adds each number to the array.
//Your code goes here:


//*****
//Rewrite the previous section so that it counts from 1 to 50 in increments of 5.
//Your code goes here:


//*****
//Rewrite the above code again, this time as a function. 
  //Assign the function to a variable so you can invoke it later by that variable name.
  //Include a parameter that represents the maximum number that the loop will count to.
  //Rewrite the code in your loop so that the loop counts to the value held by the parameter.
//Your code goes here:


//*****
//Here is a sample object:


//Write a 'for in' loop that iterates through this object and console.logs the values for each key.
//Your code goes here:


//*****
//Using the same object defined above (myObj), Write a function that:
  //Creates an array variable
  //Iterates through the object and 
    //Creates a sub-array from each key:value pair
    //pushes that sub-array into the main array
  //Return the main array
  //Your function should return an array like this:
    //[['prop1','dog'],['prop2','cat']...]
//Your code goes here:



//*****
//FizzBuzz!
//Write a function that console logs the numbers from 1 to 100. 
  //For multiples of three print “Fizz” instead of the number 
  //For the multiples of five print “Buzz”. 
  //For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print “FizzBuzz”."
  //HINT - this is a great opportunity to use the 'modulo' operator (%). 
  //How does it work?
    //modulo returns the remainder of a division operation
    //example:    var x = 3 % 2;  (x is equal to 1, or the remainder of 3 divided by 2)
    //but     var y = 4 % 2;  (y is equal to 0, or the remainder of 4 divided by 2)
    //you can use the modulo operator in an 'if' statement to determine if a number is evenly divisible by another.
