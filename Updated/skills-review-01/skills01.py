#Declare a variable, now assign a number to it. It can be any number.
#Your code goes here:


#*****
#Declare a new variable with any name you like. Make up a string value and assign it to the variable. Do all of this in one statement.
#Your code goes here:


#*****
#In one line, declare a variable and assign an empty list to that variable.
#Your code goes here:

#*****
#Using the list variable you just created, write a loop that counts from 1 to 10 and adds each number to the list.
#Your code goes here:



#*****
#Rewrite the previous section so that it counts from 1 to 50 in increments of 5.
#Your code goes here:



#*****
#Rewrite the previous section using a list comprehension.
#Your code goes here:


#*****
#Rewrite the above code again, this time as a function. 
  #Assign the function to a variable so you can invoke it later by that variable name.
  #Include a parameter that represents the maximum number that the loop will count to.
  #Rewrite the code in your loop so that the loop counts to the value held by the parameter.
#Your code goes here:

#Here is a sample dictionary:

#Write a loop that iterates through this dictionary and prints the values for each key.
#Your code goes here:



#*****
#Using the same dictionary defined above (myDict), Write a function that:
  #Creates a list variable
  #Iterates through the dictionary and 
    #Creates a sub-list from each key:value pair
    #pushes that sub-list into the main list
  #Return the main list
  #Your function should return a list like this:
    #[['prop1','dog'],['prop2','cat']...]
#Your code goes here:

#FizzBuzz!
#Write a function that prints the numbers from 1 to 100. 
  #For multiples of three print “Fizz” instead of the number 
  #For the multiples of five print “Buzz”. 
  #For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print “FizzBuzz”."
  #HINT - this is a great opportunity to use the 'modulo' operator (%). 
  #How does it work?
    #modulo returns the remainder of a division operation
    #example:    x = 3 % 2;  (x is equal to 1, or the remainder of 3 divided by 2)
    #but     y = 4 % 2;  (y is equal to 0, or the remainder of 4 divided by 2)
    #you can use the modulo operator in an 'if' statement to determine if a number is evenly divisible by another.\
