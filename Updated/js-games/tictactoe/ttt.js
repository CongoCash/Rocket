// There are many different ways to approach this challenge. Here are some suggested methods if you wish to use as a starting point. Feel free to abandon these in favor of your own coding strategy if you have a different plan. The worst thing that you can do is to try to fit your creative thoughts into a mold made by someone else. 



// It's usually a good practice to declare variables at the top of a JavaScript file. Think about what variables you might need to initialize here.


var marker = function() {
  //this function could be used to keep track of which marker is currently playing
};

var clearBoard = function () {
  // this function can be responsible for resetting the game board in the UI. It is also a convenient place to reset any variables that you use during the course of a game. 
};

var checkForWin = function(){
  // this will probably be the most involved function in this repo. Before you start writing code, consider a strategy in pseudocode that makes sense. If you can't follow the logic in plain English you will not be able to translate it into working code.
};

window.onload = function() {
  // what functions need to run at the initial load of the window? Consider what event listeners you will possibly need. Do you want to add markers by clicking? Do you want to have a button to reset the board? These will need 'click' handlers. Are there any other operations that happen at the same time? Are any of these the same as when a game is reset using the 'Reset' button? Try to be efficient with your code!
