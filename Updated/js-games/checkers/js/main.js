/*
There are just too many different ways to approach this to write a specific pattern of functions out for you. That would be like giving you a paint-by-numbers project, and that's not going to happen at RocketU!

This is a significant challenge, but a lot of fun. You will need some rather involved logic to fully implement a game. Break the problem into small pieces and develop a strategy to implement segments of the code independently. That way, you can determine if your plan is likely to work before coding the whole thing.

Here are some thoughts on functions that you might need:

createBoard
resetPieces 
movePiece
kingMe
removeJumpedPiece
checkForWin

Don't allow your thinking to be limited by this approach. Use a method that makes sense to you. Think creatively and have an expectation of success.
