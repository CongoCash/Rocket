# Using the Python language, have the function ReversePolishNotation(str) read str
# which will be an arithmetic expression composed of only integers and the operators: +,-,* and /
# and the input expression will be in postfix notation (Reverse Polish notation),
# an example: (1 + 2) * 3 would be 1 2 + 3 * in postfix notation.

# Your program should determine the answer for the given postfix expression.

# For example: if str is 2 12 + 7 / then your program should output 2.


# Ex: Input = "1 1 + 1 + 1 +"Output = 4
# Ex: Input = "4 5 + 2 1 + *"Output = 27
