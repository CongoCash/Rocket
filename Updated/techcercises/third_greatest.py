# Using the Python language, have the function third_greatest(str_arr) take the array of strings stored in str_arr
# and return the third largest word within in.

# So for example: if str_arr is ["hello", "world", "before", "all"] your output should be world
# because "before" is 6 letters long, and "hello" and "world" are both 5,
# but the output should be world because it appeared as the last 5 letter word
# in the array. If str_arr was ["hello", "world", "after", "all"] the output should be after
# because the first three words are all 5 letters long, so return the last one.
# The array will have at least three strings and each string will only contain letters.

# Ex: Input = "coder","byte","code" Output = "code"
# Ex: Input = "abc","defg","z","hijk" Output = "abc"
