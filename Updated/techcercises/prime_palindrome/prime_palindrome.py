# You are given a number and your challenge is to find the closest palindromic prime number
# that greater than what you were given.

# A palindromic number or numeral palindrome is a number that remains the same when its digits are reversed, such as 79197.
# These numbers appear to be symmetrical.
# A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.
# In this task you will be given an positive integer. You should find the closest integer that:
# - is greater than the given number;
# - is prime;
# - is palindromic.
# For example: for the number 13, the closest greater palindromic prime is 101.
# Or, for the number is 2, the answer is 3, because any one-digit number is a palindrome.

# Input: A number as an integer.

# Output: The closest greater palindromic prime as an integer.

# Example:

# golf(2) == 3
# golf(13) == 101
# golf(101) == 131

# Precondition: 0 < number < 98689
